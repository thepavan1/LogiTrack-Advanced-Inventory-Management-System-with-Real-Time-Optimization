d) Design Analysis and Algorithms (DAA)
1) System Architecture
LogiTrack follows a modular architecture with these key components:

Frontend: Streamlit-based UI with interactive visualizations

Backend: Python-based processing engine

Data Layer: CSV/DB connectors for data persistence

Optimization Engine: Core algorithms for inventory distribution

2) Core Algorithms
a) Inventory Allocation Algorithm
Problem: Optimal distribution of inventory across warehouses

Algorithm: Modified Knapsack Problem solution with constraints

Complexity: O(nW) where n=items, W=warehouse capacity

Optimization: Minimizes storage costs while meeting demand

b) Order Fulfillment Algorithm
Problem: Selecting best warehouse for order fulfillment

Algorithm: Dijkstra's variant with multi-factor scoring:

Distance to destination

Warehouse stock levels

Shipping costs

Delivery deadlines

Complexity: O(E + V log V) for route calculation

c) Warehouse Optimization
Problem: Balancing stock levels across warehouses

Algorithm: Genetic Algorithm approach with:

Chromosomes representing stock distributions

Fitness function considering:

Transportation costs

Storage costs

Demand forecasts

Complexity: O(g*n) where g=generations, n=population size

d) Route Optimization
Problem: Delivery route planning for multiple orders

Algorithm: Hybrid of Nearest Neighbor and 2-opt optimization

Complexity: O(n^2) for route improvements

3) Performance Analysis
Algorithm	Best Case	Average Case	Worst Case	Space Complexity
Inventory Allocation	O(n)	O(nW)	O(nW)	O(W)
Order Fulfillment	O(V log V)	O(E + V log V)	O(V^2)	O(V)
Warehouse Optimization	O(n)	O(g*n)	O(g*n^2)	O(n)
Route Optimization	O(n)	O(n^2)	O(n^3)	O(n^2)
4) Data Structures
Priority Queues: For order prioritization

Graphs: For warehouse network representation

Hash Tables: For fast inventory lookups

Geospatial Indices: For location-based queries
